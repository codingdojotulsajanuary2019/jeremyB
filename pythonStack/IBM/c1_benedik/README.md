# Authentication
Authentication is the term used for proving to a site you are who you say you
are. Typically this is done by logging into some site as a specific user. Users
who aren't logged in shouldn't be able to access pages that should only be
accessible to logged in users. While it certainly is important for users to only
be able to access resources when logged in, it is also important for a users
 account to be adequately protected against malicious users logging into their
accounts.

In this challenge you will need to discover and fix the authentication flaws
present in this web app.
