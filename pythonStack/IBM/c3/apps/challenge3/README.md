# Attacks

The previous two challenges focused on access - users should only be able to
access certain resources if logged in (authentication) and users should only be
able to access resources they own (authorization). While these are two very
important concepts necessary int keeping your site secure, they aren't the only
two. In this challenge there are a number of different security flaws that you
will need to discover and fix.

Happy hunting!
