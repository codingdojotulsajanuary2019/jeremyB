# Attacks

The previous two challenges focused on access - users should only be able to access certain resources if logged in
(authentication) and users should only be able to access resources they own (authorization). While these are two very
important concepts necessary int keeping your site secure, they aren't the only two. In this challenge there are a number
of different security flaws that you will need to discover and fix.

You will notice there is a link to reset your email address in this challenge. Emails sent through this request will be stored
in the the `emails` directory.

Happy hunting!
